## Some links on Rust

* [Rust IRC channel](http://client00.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust)
* [Rust for Rubyists](http://www.rustforrubyists.com/)
* [Rust Playpen](http://play.rust-lang.org/) - closest thing to a REPL  :(
* [On Rusts Module System](https://gist.github.com/DanielKeep/470f4e114d28cd0c8d43) - good explanation of paths, naming, modules -- see this when compiler complains about cannot find symbols
* [Rust By Example](http://rustbyexample.com/) - also the guide on their site is pretty good.
